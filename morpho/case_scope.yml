name: case-scope
brief: the case’s scope over adjacent formatives
full: |
  CASE-SCOPE is used in formatives marked with [[Case]] to explicitly indicate
  the case's scope or “reach” over other formatives in the same sentence,
  overriding the default rules established by the syntax.
values:
  - abbr: CCN
    name: natural
    brief: case is governed by the main verb or an Antecedent formative
    full: |
      NATURAL Case-Scope indicates that the case of the formative is governed
      by another formative in the [[Antecedent]] Case-Scope or, naturally, by
      the main verb of the clause if the former does not exist.
  - abbr: CCA
    name: antecedent
    brief: formative governs all Natural formatives
    full: |
      ANTECEDENT Case-Scope indicates that the formative is the “head”, which

      [[Natural]], overriding the main verb.
  - abbr: CCS
    name: subaltern
    brief: formative governs all Qualifier formatives
    full: |
      SUBALTERN Case-Scope indicates that the formative governs all other
      formatives in the clause whose Case-Scope is the [[Qualifier]],

    name: qualifier
    brief: case is governed by a Subaltern formative
    full: |
      QUALIFIER Case-Scope indicates that the case of the formative is
      governed by another formative in the [[Subaltern]] case-scope,
      providing a mechanism secondary to [[Natural]]–[[Antecedent]].
  - abbr: CCP
    name: precedent
    brief: case is governed by the following formative
    full: |
      PRECEDENT Case-Scope indicates that the case of the formative is
      governed by an immediately following formative in the clause,
      which does not need to be marked for Case-Scope.
  - abbr: CCV
    name: successive
    brief: case is governed by the previous formative
    full: |
      SUCCESSIVE Case-Scope indicates that the case of the formative is
      governed by an immediately preceding formative in the clause, which
      does not need to be marked for Case-Scope.
